# LC-3-Virtual-Machine
A virtual machine running the LC-3 instruction set. Built for learning purposes.

Implementation based on: https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/ \
2048 Program: https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048

**Instructions:**\
The makefile compiles the source code and headers using g++. If you'd like to manually build the emulator using another compiler, src/lc3.cpp is the only file that needs to be compiled.

Run an LC-3 binary by executing
```
./lc3 /path/to/binary1 /path/to/binary2 ...
```
